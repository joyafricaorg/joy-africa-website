                        <h3>1. The JOY AFRICA KIDS HOUSE</h3>
                        <p><strong>Project Overview:</strong> This is our most ambitious project: to build a safe, loving, and permanent home for homeless children in Uganda. The project includes buying land and constructing a full-service house with a playground, offering holistic support for their physical, emotional, and educational needs.</p>
                        <p><strong>Impact:</strong> This home will be a sanctuary‚Äîa place where vulnerable children can find stability, receive quality care, and simply be children. It is a direct investment in their future, breaking the cycle of poverty and homelessness.</p>
                        <div class="budget"><strong>Total Budget: $200,000</strong> (Land: $45k, Construction: $100k, Playground: $20k, Furnishings: $15k, Management: $20k)</div>

                        <p><strong>Project Overview:</strong> With 83% of Ugandans lacking access to safe water, this project is a matter of life and death. We will construct boreholes, wells, and rainwater collection tanks, and conduct community-wide training on hygiene and water safety.</p>
                        <p><strong>Impact:</strong> Clean water reduces disease, keeps children in school, and empowers communities. By providing this basic human right, we unlock a healthier and more prosperous future for thousands of people.</p>

                        <p><strong>Project Overview:</strong> Education is the key to breaking the chains of poverty. This program ensures children can succeed in school by paying their tuition fees, providing essential school supplies, uniforms, and shoes, and offering after-school tutoring and mentorship.</p>
                        <p><strong>Impact:</strong> We are seeing increased enrollment, reduced dropout rates, and improved academic performance. This program gives children the tools they need to build their own future.</p>
