                        <h4>TUMUSIIME GONZAGA</h4>
                        <p>Tumusiime Gonzaga is a Ugandan man born on October 21st, 2002, in a small slum town called Kosovo in Kampala, Uganda. Raised in a God-fearing Christian family, his education was sponsored by an NGO called VISION FOR AFRICA INTERNATIONAL MINISTRIES, from Primary One through his diploma in Journalism and Media Studies. While growing up, he faced many challenges, such as the lack of a good health center, high levels of insecurity in the slum, and a lack of proper schools for his friends. All of this inspired him to start an NGO that would help other kids avoid the same problems he and his friends faced. JOY AFRICA INTERNATIONAL FOUNDATION acts as a symbol of change for these communities.</p>
