                <h3>Our Purpose</h3>
                <p>The purpose of JOY AFRICA INTERNATIONAL FOUNDATION is to improve the lives of children in different communities around Uganda by providing them with access to quality education, healthcare, protection, clean and safe water, and empowering them to reach their full potential.</p>
                
                <h3>Our Aims</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>To provide a safe and nurturing environment for children to grow and develop.</li>
                    <li>To improve access to quality education and healthcare for children.</li>
                    <li>To protect children from exploitation, abuse, and neglect.</li>
                    <li>To empower children and communities to take charge of their own development.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Our History</h3>
                <p>JOY AFRICA INTERNATIONAL FOUNDATION (formerly African Heart International Organisation) was founded in 2022 by Tumusiime Gonzaga. He started by calling for simple donations to different communities, even though he had little himself. He was later joined by his friends, Mulochu Newton and Kulubya Paul. In 2023, they took on their first child, paying for school fees and care out of their own pockets. By 2024, this number grew to 16 children. Now, we are planning our biggest project yet for December 2025: "EVERYONE CAN DRINK HEALTHY," to provide safe drinking water to communities in need.</p>

                <h3>Meet Our Founder: Tumusiime Gonzaga</h3>
                <p>Tumusiime Gonzaga, a male Ugandan born on October 21st, 2002, grew up in the Kosovo slum of Kampala. Raised in a God-fearing Christian family, his own education was sponsored by an NGO, Vision for Africa International Ministries. Growing up, he witnessed firsthand the challenges of his community: lack of good health centers, insecurity, and poor schools for his friends. This inspired him to start an NGO to ensure other children wouldn't face the same struggles. JOY AFRICA INTERNATIONAL FOUNDATION stands as a symbol of hope and change for these communities.</p>
